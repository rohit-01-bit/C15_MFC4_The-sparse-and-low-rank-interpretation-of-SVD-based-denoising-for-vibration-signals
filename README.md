# C15_MFC4_The-sparse-and-low-rank-interpretation-of-SVD-based-denoising-for-vibration-signals
This repository bridges SVD-based denoising for vibration signals with sparse/low-rank models. It proves TSVD equals l0-norm minimization under specific dictionaries, links to weighted l1-norm, and proposes Weighted Soft SVD (WSSVD) for better amplitude fidelity in fault diagnosis. Validated on bearing data with impulse noise.
