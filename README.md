#Project Outline 

SVD-based denoising for vibration signals with sparse/low-rank models. It proves TSVD equals l0-norm minimization under specific dictionaries, links to weighted l1-norm, and proposes Weighted Soft SVD (WSSVD) for better amplitude fidelity in fault diagnosis. Validated on bearing data with impulse noise.
